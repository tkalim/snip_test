    "- (i) recommending articles/videos to people based on their interaction\n",
    "- (ii) giving context to an article (that is give content related to an article to allow the user to go deeper into a subject)\n",
    "- (iii) giving the most relevant content following query (search engine).\n",

    "- (v) extracting the most important information from an article to transform it into a snip\n",
